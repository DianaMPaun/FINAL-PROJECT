	Exploring Genre Classification in Literature: A Comparative Analysis of Prediction Models
  In this study, we delve into the realm of genre classification in literature using various predictive models. Our research explores the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in classifying literary works into distinct genres such as fantasy, fiction, nonfiction, romance, and more. By employing techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and model evaluation metrics, we compare the performance of models including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Through this comparative analysis, we aim to unravel insights into the most effective methodologies for genre classification in literature, shedding light on the nuances and challenges inherent in predicting literary genres using computational techniques.
