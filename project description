The "Book Survey and Recommendation System" is a data-driven project designed to gather insights into readers' preferences and provide personalized book recommendations for new users. The project comprises a survey where participants are asked to indicate whether they have read a selection of 50 books and rate them on a scale of 1 to 5. Additionally, respondents have the option to mark books they haven't read with a "Not read" designation.

Using the collected survey data, we have developed a recommendation model that leverages advanced algorithms to analyze users' reading habits and preferences. By considering factors such as book ratings, genre preferences, and reading history, the recommendation system generates tailored suggestions for new users based on their interests and tastes.

Our goal with this project is to enhance the reading experience by providing individuals with personalized book recommendations that align closely with their interests and reading preferences. Whether users are seeking gripping thrillers, thought-provoking nonfiction, or heartwarming classics, our recommendation system aims to connect them with books they'll love and enjoy.

Join us on a journey through the world of literature, where every reader can discover new stories and embark on captivating literary adventures tailored to their unique tastes.
